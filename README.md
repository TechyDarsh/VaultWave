Project Overview
The Trading Prediction Bot is a machine learning-based tool that forecasts stock market and cryptocurrency price trends. By leveraging historical market data, the bot can make predictions on future price movements, helping traders make informed decisions. The project utilizes cutting-edge deep learning algorithms implemented using the Keras framework, and processes market data using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for visualization.

Key Features:
Data Sourcing: The bot retrieves historical stock and cryptocurrency data using yfinance and Binance.
Machine Learning Model: Built with Keras, the bot uses deep learning to predict trends based on input features like historical prices, volumes, and other market indicators.
Data Processing: Pandas is used for data manipulation, while NumPy facilitates efficient numerical computations.
Visualization: Predictions and historical trends are visualized using Matplotlib, making it easier to understand market trends.
Libraries Used:
Keras: For building and training the prediction model.
NumPy: For numerical computation and matrix operations.
Pandas: For handling and preprocessing the market datasets.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizing predictions.
yfinance & Binance: For fetching stock and cryptocurrency data, respectively.
Usage:
The bot processes historical data to train a model and then outputs predictions that can guide trading decisions. This project can be extended with more sophisticated models or additional market indicators to improve prediction accuracy.
